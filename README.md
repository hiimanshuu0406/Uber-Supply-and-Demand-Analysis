# 🚖 Uber Supply–Demand Gap Analysis
📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes Uber ride request data to identify the supply–demand gap in different time slots and pickup points. By combining Excel, SQL, and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the project explores cancellations, unavailability of cars, and completed trips to uncover the operational challenges Uber faces.

🎯 Objectives
1. Clean and prepare raw Uber ride request data for analysis.
2. Build dashboards in Excel to visualize ride demand, cancellations, and driver availability.
3. Use SQL to extract structured insights such as incomplete trips, cancellations, and hourly trends.
4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas & Seaborn to uncover deeper patterns.
5. Provide recommendations to reduce the supply-demand gap.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
1. Excel – Data cleaning, dashboards
2. SQL (MySQL Workbench) – Queries for insights
3. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – EDA & visualizations

📊 SQL Queries & Explanation
CREATE DATABASE Uber_Data_Project;
USE Uber_Data_Project;
